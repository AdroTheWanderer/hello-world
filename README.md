Just repository to begin for myself how to use GitHub

Here Adro, What´s up people!  \°o°/

Even thought I have been studying at the University in Software Engenieer I felt like a newbie.
At this point only a litlle of C++, C# , SQL ,Java, JavaScript, React, Python is my actual knowledge. Unfortunately I don´t find capable yet to do big projects with these tools. I hope to make some day something big enough to get a great amount of revenues and keep only looking to this vast and complex world.

#include <iostream>
#include <conio.h>

using namespace std;

void main()
{
  cout<<"Hello World Adro h3rE"<<endl;
  
  _getch();
  
}
